## Flavor Profile

### Strong Preferences
- Miso + garlic + soy combinations
- Tomato-based sauces and salsas
- Generous red pepper flakes on Italian dishes
- Complex, layered flavors (reference: coconut-miso salmon curry)
- Bold seasonings over subtle

### Spice Tolerance
- Comfortable range: jalapeño through habanero
- Generous with crushed red pepper
- Not seeking extreme heat (ghost pepper+), but don't underseason

### Hard Restrictions
- **NEVER**: Clams, mussels, anchovies
- **AVOID**: Blue cheese/gorgonzola (Jennifer dislikes)
- **REDUCE**: Sausage and bacon (health-conscious, but occasional use fine)
- **SKIP**: Bland steamed fish, unseasoned proteins

## Proteins

### Regular Rotation
- Chicken breast
- Ground turkey
- Ground beef
- Steak (reasonable cuts, not daily)

### Want More Of (Active Goal)
- Salmon (reference: NYT coconut-miso salmon curry)
- Shrimp (bold preparations: fajitas, scampi, poke-style)
- Canned tuna (over rice, poke-style, not sad desk lunch)
- White fish with interesting preparations

### Seafood Challenge Context
The household wants to cook more fish but struggles with:
- 30%: Technique (overcooking)
- 70%: Finding recipes that aren't boring

**For any fish/shrimp recipe, include specific technique guidance.**

### Avoid
- Clams, mussels, anchovies (never)
- Rack of lamb, lobster tail (budget)
- Excessive processed meats
